  Tetris game page

  This standalone HTML file bundles together a canvas‑based Tetris game with
  styles inspired by Building Thingz’s website. The dark, textured
  background and colourful gradient blocks evoke the playfulness of the
  reference design. To embed this into your Framer site, host this file
  somewhere accessible and use a Framer Code component or an <iframe>
  pointing at it.
